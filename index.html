                <p>I'm a software engineering leader, musician, and builder of things, equally at home casting vision at the executive level and engaging in the hard, detailed, day-in and day-out work to bring products to market.
                <br><br>Most recently, I led the software engineering team at <a href="https://www.zoomcare.com/" class="link-dark link-offset-2 link-underline-opacity-0 link-underline-opacity-100-hover"><strong>ZoomCare</strong></a> as <strong>Director of Engineering</strong>, modernizing and rebuilding a full suite of internal and B2B/B2C applications including an proprietary EMR and the site and apps at <a href="https://www.zoomcare.com/" class="link-dark link-offset-2 link-underline-opacity-0 link-underline-opacity-100-hover">zoomcare.com</a>.
                <br><br>Prior to that I worked for <a href="https://www.corvel.com/" class="link-dark link-offset-2 link-underline-opacity-0 link-underline-opacity-100-hover"><strong>CorVel Corporation</strong></a>, starting as a junior QA Engineer and leaving as <strong>Director, Information Systems</strong>, having built QA test automation and Release Engineering teams, re-defined the QA team and processes, and contributed to hundreds of releases of our Bill Review, Claims Management, and Case Management applications, including <a href="https://www.corvel.com/technology/caremc-edge/" class="link-dark link-offset-2 link-underline-opacity-0 link-underline-opacity-100-hover">Care<sup>MC</sup> Edge</a>.
                <br><br>Whether it's finding a way to decompose a legacy monolithic backend into modern RESTful APIs without any interruption to service (we did that at ZoomCare), building a custom automation framework (the one we built at CorVel is still one of the coolest tools I've used for E2E testing), or shepherding / obsessing a people-first culture (because <i>what</i> we get done matters for this year's deliverables, but <i>how</i> we get it done matters for the next 10 years of deliverables) I bring energy, excitement, and an infectious roll-up-your-sleeves-and-get-stuff-done attitude to the teams I work with.
                <br><br>I'm known as a servant leader, pushing us to constantly improve and tackle the next problem - because every problem is, in fact, solvable.</p>

Worked with other Engineering Leaders to design systems to scale the department and implement best practices for team intake, prioritization, innovation, delivery, and accountability. Provided individual mentorship and department level goal setting.</li>
                                    <li>Managed a product portfolio of seven applications. Established a strategic and technical roadmap for a complete rebuild of all backends and frontends of ZoomCare's proprietary Electronic Health Record (EHR) system, decomposing a legacy monolith into a microservice architecture with a microfrontend orchestrator.</li>
                                    <li>In partnership with the Enterprise Architecture team, established a feature-flagged event-driven architecture and a legacy mimic pattern to roll features out incrementally with zero impact to the 600 healthcare providers and associates providing care to over a thousand patients a day, allowing for prototyping and rapid iteration with reliability.</li>
                                    <li>Partnered with Product and executive leadership to lead product development: delivered multiple product launches, including a new patient record management backend, Electronic Health Record (EHR) core backend refactors, online bill pay solutions. Developed and delivered FHIR and HL7 integrations between our EHR and third-party systems for Revenue Cycle Management (RCM), payment management, and Health Information Exchanges (HIE).</li>
                                    <li>Managed an annual budget of $12 million to recruit, hire, and train the teams necessary to deliver on our priorities. Oversaw the 3x growth of the engineering department to 120 fully-remote engineers distributed across four continents, maintaining an 8.8/10 e-NPS score and 1% turnover.</li>
                                    <li>Planned, created and implemented production incident management and support teams, workflows to improve systems reliability. Implemented incident response tools, KPIs, and SLAs, driving system uptime from 97% up to 99.9%, and 75% decrease in Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR).</li>
                                    <li>Collaborated across the organization as a technical service partner to align roadmaps, compliance needs, and technical requirements to business gaps and operational strategy. Researched industry trends and evaluated vendor capabilities for build vs. buy decisions.</li>
