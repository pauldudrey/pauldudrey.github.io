                    <p>I'm a software engineering leader, musician, and builder of things, equally at home casting vision at the executive level and engaging in the hard, detailed, day-in and day-out work to bring products to market.
                        <br><br>Most recently, I led the software engineering team at ZoomCare as Director of Engineering, modernizing and rebuilding a full suite of internal and B2B/B2C applications including an proprietary EMR and the site and apps at <a href="https://www.zoomcare.com/" class="link-dark link-offset-2 link-underline-opacity-0 link-underline-opacity-100-hover">zoomcare.com</a>.
                        
                        <br><br>Prior to that I worked for CorVel Corporation, starting as a junior QA Engineer and leaving as a Director, having built QA test automation and Release Engineering teams, re-defined the QA team and processes, and contributed to hundreds of releases of our Bill Review, Claims Management, and Case Management applications.
                        
                        <br><br>Whether it's finding a way to decompose a legacy monolithic backend into modern RESTful APIs without any interruption to service (we did that at ZoomCare), building a custom automation framework (the one we built at CorVel is still one of the coolest tools I've used for E2E testing), or shepherding / obsessing a people-first culture (because <i>what</i> we get done matters for this year's deliverables, but <i>how</i> we get it done matters for the next 10 years of deliverables) I bring energy, excitement, and an infectious roll-up-your-sleeves-and-get-stuff-done attitude to the teams I work with.
                        <br><br>I'm known as a servant leader, first in the charge and last in the retreat, pushing us to constantly improve and tackle the next problem - because every problem is, in fact, solvable.
                        </p>
